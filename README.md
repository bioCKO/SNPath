# SNPath
An R package for pathway analysis of GWAS data (SNPath).

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) assess the association between individual SNPs and
disease risk, and have successfully identified susceptibility loci for various complex diseases. In
addition, many methods have been proposed to evaluate the association between disease risk and
a set of SNPs that belongs to functional gene sets or pathways. The SNPath package contains four
different algorithms in the literature: grass, gseaSnp, plinkSet and aligator. Users
can use any one of them to identify pathways that are associated with disease risk; meanwhile, this
package provides a nice and convenient platform for comparison of different algorithms as well.
